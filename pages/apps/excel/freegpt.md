# FreeGPT for Excel

Unlimited free AI running locally in Excel.

## Overview

Provides unlimited free and secure AI by using smaller models that can run locally on your computer.  The catch?  These models are incredibly good for their size, but are slow and dumb compared to the current version ChatGPT.  However, GPUs are becoming more powerful, and small models are getting smarter, so speed and quality should both continue to improve.  We're starting with a handful of functions and will add more over time.

## Features

ðŸ†“ Unlimited free use<br>
ðŸ’» Processed locally on your computer.<br>
ðŸ”’ No data is shared outside Excel.<br>

## Limitations
- The models are smaller and less powerful than ChatGPT.  Depending on your task, they may be more than enough, or not enough at all. YMMV.
- Compared to online services like ChatGPT, running the models on your computer will be slow, in some cases painfully slow.  However, this is changing quickly as embedded GPUs are getting more powerful.
- The PROMPT function requires a GPU that supports `shader-f16`.

## Functions

Each of the function currently uses a different specialized AI model to perform a specific task.  We're using models that will run on CPU where possible to make them available to the most users, but some functions (e.g. PROMPT) requireS a GPU. 

### Classify

Runs on CPU.

=<code>FREEGPT.CLASSIFY (text, categories)</code><br>
<code>text:</code> Text to classify.<br>
<code>categories:</code> Range of categories.<br>
E.g., to classify the content of cell A1 into categories listed in cells B1 to B5:<br>
<code>=FREEGPT.CLASSIFY(A1, B1:B5)</code><br>

### Prompt

This requires a GPU that supports `shader-f16` and consumes roughly 3-4GB of memory for the base model.

=<code>FREEGPT.PROMPT (prompt, [data], [options])</code><br>
<code>prompt:</code> Instructions for model, e.g. "What is the problem this user is having?<br>
<code>data:</code> Optional data to provide context to the model. If a range of cells is provided, it will be converted to a list added to the prompt.  Continuing with the example above, this could be a cell with a support ticket description.<br>
<code>options:</code> Range of processing options.  This is a placeholder and currently does nothing.  In future, it will enable setting things like temperature, model, etc.<br>

### Summarize

Runs on CPU.

=<code>FREEGPT.SUMMARIZE (text)</code><br>
<code>text:</code> Text to summarize.<br>
E.g., to summarize the content of cell A1:<br>
<code>=FREEGPT.SUMMARIZE(A1)</code><br>

### Translate

Runs on CPU.

=<code>FREEGPT.TRANSLATE (text, source_lang, target_lang, [model])</code><br>
<code>text:</code> Must be less than 1000 characters.<br>
<code>source_lang:</code> Text language, e.g. "fr" for French.<br>
<code>target_lang:</code> Translation language, e.g. "en" for English.<br>
E.g., to translate cell A1 from French to English:<br>
<code>=FREEGPT.TRANSLATE(A1, "fr", "en")</code><br>

Either the source or target language must be English "<code>en</code>", and the other language may be any one of the following: 

Afrikaans "<code>af</code>", Arabic "<code>ar</code>", Czech "<code>cs</code>", Danish "<code>da</code>", Dutch "<code>nl</code>", Finnish "<code>fi</code>", French "<code>fr</code>", German "<code>de</code>", Hindi "<code>hi</code>", Hungarian "<code>hu</code>", Indonesian "<code>id</code>", Italian "<code>it</code>", Japanese "<code>jap</code>", Russian "<code>ru</code>", Spanish "<code>es</code>", Swedish "<code>sv</code>", Ukrainian "<code>uk</code>", Vietnamese "<code>vi</code>", Xhosa "<code>xh</code>", Chinese "<code>zh</code>"


## Applications

Use for simple or less critical tasks that do not require a powerful AI model.

## Installation
