# Translate for Excel

Like GOOGLETRANSLATE for Excel. Translates text to English for free, on your CPU, albeit slowly.

## Overview

Provides a TRANSLATE function for Excel similar to GOOGLETRANSLATE.  It translates text using a machine learning model running in Excel on your CPU so your data never leaves your spreadsheet, and you have unlimited free use.  The catch is that it is very slow, so it needs to be run while you do other things, possibly overnight if you have a lot of text.  Currently it is limited to translating a few languages to English, but the plan is to make it equivalent to the Google Translate (GOOGLETRANSLATE) function, but for Excel.

<h3>FEATURES</h3>

üåêTranslate text in several languages to English.<br>
üÜìUnlimited free use.<br>

<b>=BOARDFLARE.TRANSLATE</b>(input_text, input_lang)<br>
‚û°Ô∏èinput_text: text you want to translate<br>
‚û°Ô∏èinput_lang: language code of the input_text, see below for languages<br>
‚¨ÖÔ∏èreturns: translated text in English<br>

For example, to translate a cell A1 from Spanish to English: =BOARDFLARE.TRANSLATE(A1, "es")
