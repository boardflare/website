# Translate for Excel

Like GOOGLETRANSLATE for Excel. Translates text to English for free, on your CPU, albeit slowly.

## Overview

Provides a TRANSLATE function for Excel similar to GOOGLETRANSLATE.  It translates text using a machine learning model running in Excel on your CPU so your data never leaves your spreadsheet, and you have unlimited free use.  The catch is that it is very slow, so it needs to be run while you do other things, possibly overnight if you have a lot of text.  Currently it is limited to translating a few languages to English, but the plan is to make it equivalent to the Google Translate (GOOGLETRANSLATE) function, but for Excel.

<h3>LIMITATIONS</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Only supports translating a few languages to English.</li>
    <li>Very slow, as in painfully slow, don't say we didn't warn you.</li>
</ul>

## Usage

The function is used as follows.  Since it only translates to English, only the input text and input language are required.  The input language is a two-letter language code, such as "es" for Spanish.  The function is used as follows

```excel
=BOARDFLARE.TRANSLATE(input_text, input_lang)
```

For example, to translate a cell A1 from Spanish to English:
```excel
=BOARDFLARE.TRANSLATE(A1, "es")
```
