# Local GPT for Excel

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸ§ª">
  **EXPERIMENTAL**:  Please provide [feedback](/company/support).
</Callout>

## Overview

Provides unlimited free and private AI inference by using a smaller language model, currently [Gemma2 2B](https://github.com/google-deepmind/gemma), that runs locally on your computer so your data never leaves Excel.  While not as fast and smart as ChatGPT, maybe it is all you need for simple tasks.  If you have a discrete GPU on your computer, it may be possible to run much larger and more powerful models. Please [let us know](/company/support) if you are interested in this.

Install from the Microsoft AppSource store at the link below, or directly from Excel.

## Features

ðŸ†“ Unlimited free use.<br/>
ðŸ’» Processed locally on your computer.<br/>
ðŸ”’ No data is shared outside Excel.<br/>

## Requirements
Your computer must support [WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API) and specifically `shader-f16`.  Results of our check:

<DeviceInfo />

## Functions

This app provides only one general function.  This can be used to create specialized LAMBDA functions as outlined later.

### LOCAL.GPT

=<code>BOARDFLARE.LOCAL.GPT (prompt, [options])</code><br/>
- prompt: Instructions for model
- options: Placeholder for options such as system message, temperature, max tokens, etc., currently does nothing.

## Examples

### Simple

```excel
=BOARDFLARE.LOCAL.GPT("What is the problem this user is having?  Support Ticket: " & A1)
```

### LAMBDA

```excel
=LAMBDA(
    ticket, 
    BOARDFLARE.LOCAL.GPT(
        "What is the problem this user is having? Support Ticket: " & ticket
    )
)
```

This could then be named and used like `=USERPROBLEM(A1)`

## Applications

Use for simple or less critical tasks that do not require a powerful AI model.
