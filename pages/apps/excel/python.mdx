## Overview

Run Python code as a function to power your formulas and LAMBDA functions, which is not possible with Excel's native `PY` feature.  It is as simple as the following:
    
```excel
=LAMBDA(x, BOARDFLARE.RUNPY("arg1 + 2", x))
=MYFUNC(5) = 7
```
This enables you to build custom functions using Python without building a custom Excel add-in.  This was originally conceived as an internal tool for prototyping custom functions based on Python.  We realized that others could benefit from the same capability, so we decided to publish it as a free add-in.

## Benefits

This is a minimalist tool which is not designed to compete with the native [Python in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-python-in-excel-a33fbcbe-065b-41d3-82cf-23d05397f53d), but it does offer some unique benefits as follows:

‚úÖ Use Python as a function in formulas and LAMBDAs.<br/>
üÜì Free add-in, no Office 365 license required.<br/>
üåê Works in Excel for web as well as desktop.<br/>
‚òÅÔ∏è Runtime has network access for API calls (need CORS).<br/>
üì¶ Import custom packages (pure Python only).<br/>
üîí Runs locally, so no data is shared outside Excel.<br/>
‚û°Ô∏è Code can be loaded from a URL (e.g. GitHub).<br/>
üöÄ Performance is only limited by your CPU.<br/>

## Python Runtime

[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/index.html) is the Python runtime used by the add-in, which is based on [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) running in the browser used by Excel desktop and web to host add-ins.  This is currently running Python 3.12, but has limitations as discussed in the [Pyodide documentation](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/wasm-constraints.html).

### Packages

Pyodide includes a number of [built-in packages](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html). You can import any of these packages as well as those from the Python standard library. Any imports for external Python packages will be loaded from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), but only if they are pure Python, which means there is a Python wheel that ends with `-py3-none-any.whl`, e.g. `beautifulsoup4-4.12.3-py3-none-any.whl`.  Packages tagged as [OS-independent](https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Operating+System+%3A%3A+OS+Independent) on PyPI should work, but double-check the wheel.

You do not need to install packages, just import them in your code. Your code will be scanned for imports and any found will be handled for you using `micropip` in the background and the package will be downloaded if needed from PyPI. If you try to import an external package (not part of the Python standard library or one of the built-in packages) for which there is not a pure Python wheel available on PyPI, an error will be thrown.

However, specific imports (e.g., `from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential`) will not automatically install the relevant package. You need to handle these manually using `await micropip.install(['package1', 'package2'])`. `micropip` has already been imported for you.  For example:

```python
await micropip.install(['azure-ai-textanalytics'])

from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
```

### Network Access

Network access is available to the Pyodide runtime via JavaScript. You should be able to access any public API that supports [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).  For example, you can use the `requests` package to access APIs that support CORS. For example, the following code fetches the GitHub API:
  
  ```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.github.com')
response.json()
```

### Security

The Pyodide runtime runs in a [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), which is a separate thread from the main Excel add-in thread, and does not, as far as we know, have direct access to any Excel APIs or your workbook other than the data you pass to it as arg1, arg2, etc.  However, hackers are creative and tend to find security loopholes, so just like with VBA, you should never run code from an untrusted source.

## RUNPY Function

The `RUNPY` function executes Python code and returns the result.  Optional positional arguments `arg1, arg2, ...` (similar to Python *args) are set as globals to pass as arguments of your Python function.

```excel
=BOARDFLARE.RUNPY(code, [arg1],[arg2],...)
```

```excel
=BOARDFLARE.RUNPY("2 + arg1", 3)
=5
```

### Code

`code` must be a string containing Python code, which can be a simple expression or a block of code.  `code` can also be a URL, e.g. `https://gist.github.com...code.py`, which must return code in plain text.  Note that the URL must be `https` and return an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) header.

Your Python code can import any of the built-in packages in Pyodide, as well as any pure Python package from PyPI, as per the [Python Packages](#python-packages) section above.

The value of the last expression in your Python code is returned, similar to a Jupyter notebook cell, or Excel `PY`.  A good practice is to wrap your code in a function, and then call that function on the last line.  For example, the following code returns the sum of the arguments:

```python
def add(a, b):
  return a + b

add(arg1,arg2)
```
Or, the same thing using numpy would be as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def add(a, b):
    return np.add(a, b).item()

result = add(arg1, arg2)
```
Note that the last expression must return one of [these types](#return-types): int, float, str, bool, or list.

Any output to `stdout` or `stderr` is displayed in the Console area of the add-in task pane, but it is only returned at the completion of the execution of your code, so you can't use use `print` statements to view progress of long-running operations.

### Arguments

| Argument | Type            | Optional | Description                                                                |
|----------|-----------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| code     | string          | No       | Python code text, or URL as per [above](#code).  |
| arg1     | scalar or array | Yes      | Repeating argument that sets global variables `arg1, arg2, ..` which you can then use in your code to pass in data.                             |

The table below shows how argument values for `arg1, arg2, ..` are converted from Excel to Python types:

| Excel Type | Example                        | Python Type |
|------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| Number     | 42                             | int         |
| Number     | 3.14                           | float       |
| String     | "hello"                        | str         |
| Boolean    | TRUE                           | bool        |
| Array      | `{1, 2, 3}`                    | DataFrame   |
| Array      | A1:B2                          | DataFrame   |
| Null       | Reference to an empty cell     | None        |
| Null       | Unset optional LAMBDA argument | None        |
| Null       | Arg skipped with `,`           | None        |

- Argument values are cleared after each function invocation.
- Arrays are converted to a pandas DataFrame without headers.
- Skipping an arg with a comma, sets that arg to None. e.g. `=BOARDFLARE.RUNPY("some code",,3)` sets `arg1 = None` and `arg2 = 3`.
- Unset optional args in a LAMBDA also become `None`. e.g. `=LAMBDA([x], BOARDFLARE.RUNPY("3 + arg1", x))()` will set `arg1 = None` and throw an error in this example because `None` is not a valid Python type for the `+` operator, so you would need to handle this case in your Python code.

### Returns

The last expression will be converted to the corresponding Excel type as follows:

| Python Type             | Example            | Excel Type |
|-------------------------|--------------------|------------|
| int                     | 42                 | Number     |
| float                   | 3.14               | Number     |
| str                     | "hello"            | String     |
| bool                    | True               | Boolean    |
| 2D list (Matrix)        | [[1, 2], [3, 4]]   | Array      |
| 2D list (Column Vector) | [[1], [2], [3]]    | Array      |
| 2D list (Row Vector)    | [[1, 2, 3]]        | Array      |

If the last expression returns another Python type such as numpy array, pandas DataFrame, dict, tuple, etc., it will throw an error.  If you need to return a more complex data structure, you can convert it to a JSON string first.

### Workbooks

- [Simple Examples](https://whistlernetworks.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Boardflare/EZ3eKR1wcltImmG2OA4sX-kB8RSA2cvJFM-hPoQGGdwMmA?e=m0eFdd) shows basic usage and also demonstrates how the same code can also be used in Excel PY().
- [Fuzzy Matching with text_distance](https://whistlernetworks.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Boardflare/EZGMy4IzfYhEsB4Vvi72r-YBIsneUMXilM8_Cv2T-WTvvQ?e=jVv6Bq) is a more advanced example using an imported Python package and loads code from our functions repository.  Click on the documentation link in the workbook for more details.

### Code

Here are some simple code examples to get you started:

```python
# Function to convert inches to mm.
def inches_to_mm(inches):
    return inches * 25.4

inches_to_mm(arg1)
```

```python
# Function to calculate the area of a circle.
import math

def circle_area(radius):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2

circle_area(arg1)
```

```python
# Function to extract email address from a string.
import re

def extract_email(text):
    return re.search(r'[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+', text).group(0)

extract_email(arg1)
```

## Errors

Here are some Excel errors you may encounter:

- `#VALUE!`:  An argument to a function is missing or it is the wrong type (e.g. incorrect range reference).
- `#NAME?`:  The function name is spelled incorrectly, e.g. `BOARDFLARE.RUNPYY`.
- `#BUSY!`:  This is normal for 5-10 seconds if you are importing libraries for the first time and have a slow internet connection. 

To the left of the bottom of the task pane, you may also see additional errors such as the following:

- `Error loading add-ins`
- `We're starting the add-ins runtime, just a moment...`

Unfortunately, the custom function capability of Excel can be a bit buggy and will throw various errors when the custom function is not being properly initialized by Excel.  If you think this is the case, try restarting Excel, or reloading the browser window.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Can I link to code in OneDrive or SharePoint?</summary>
  No.  Public links to files in OneDrive or SharePoint will not work due to lack of CORS headers, but we plan to add a feature to enable users to share and load code from OneDrive or SharePoint, similar to how [Office Scripts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/scripts/overview/excel) currently work.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I use a GitHub Gist or raw link to a file in a public GitHub repo?</summary>
  Yes. Both apply CORS. Note that GitHub Gist raw links change each time you edit the file and create a new version.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I use a URL to a file in a private GitHub repo?</summary>
  No.  The URL must be public and accessible without authentication.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is the code compatible with the native Excel PY function?</summary>
  Yes.  Just define the global variables `arg1, arg2,...` at the top as shown in the highlighted lines below.  `RUNPY` converts Excel arrays to pandas DataFrames without headers the same as Excel PY does.

  ```python {1-2}
arg1 = xl("A2")
arg2 = xl("B2")

def add(a, b):
  return a + b

add(arg1,arg2)
```
</details>

## Use Cases

Some key use-cases we see are as follows:

1. **Python-powered LAMBDAs**: `RUNPY` allows Python to be used inside LAMBDA functions enabling them to be as powerful as custom functions which previously required building an Excel add-in.

2. **Local Processing**: Often local processing is preferred for privacy, peformance, or cost reasons.

3. **Accessing APIs**:  e.g. using LLM from OpenAI, loading or pushing data where Power Query is not suitable, etc.
