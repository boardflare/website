## Overview

Runs Python code as a function so you can incorporate it into your formulas and LAMBDA functions.  For example, incorporating Python code in a LAMBDA function which is then named `MYFUNC` and called with `5, 3`:
    
```excel
=LAMBDA(x, y, BOARDFLARE.PY("pyout = data1 * data2", x, y))
=MYFUNC(5, 3)
```
This enables you to create extremely powerful custom functions without needing to build a custom Excel add-in.

## Features

Some key differences compared to the native [Python in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-python-in-excel-a33fbcbe-065b-41d3-82cf-23d05397f53d) are as follows:

üÜì Free add-in, no Office 365 license required.<br/>
üåê Works in Excel for web as well as desktop.<br/>
‚òÅÔ∏è Runtime has network access for API calls.<br/>
üì¶ Import custom packages (pure Python only).<br/>
üîí Runs locally, so no data is shared outside Excel.<br/>
‚úÖ Can be used inside formulas and LAMBDA functions.<br/>
‚û°Ô∏è Code can be centralized and loaded from a URL.<br/>
üöÄ Performance is only limited by your CPU.<br/>

## Runtime

[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/index.html) is the Python runtime, which is based on [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) running in the browser used by Excel desktop and web to host add-ins.  This is currently running Python 3.12, but has limitations as discussed in the [Pyodide documentation](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/wasm-constraints.html).

Pyodide includes a number of [built-in packages](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html). You can import any of these packages as well as those from the Python standard library. Any imports for external Python packages will be loaded from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), but only if they are pure Python, which means there is a Python wheel that ends with `-py3-none-any.whl`, e.g. `beautifulsoup4-4.12.3-py3-none-any.whl`.  Packages tagged as [OS-independent](https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Operating+System+%3A%3A+OS+Independent) on PyPI should work, but double-check the wheel.

Any output to `stdout` or `stderr` is displayed in the Console area of the add-in task pane. This is useful for debugging your code, and also for displaying intermediate results of long-running operations such as functions that are processing large input arrays. 

Global variables are used to pass data to your code, as discussed in more detail below.  Global variables are cleared after each function invocation, so no state is maintained between calls.

## Functions

Functions are accessed in the `BOARDFLARE` namespace (e.g. `=BOARDFLARE.PY(code, [data1])`).  See our [example workbook](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AmvHMvGKbZDOibEu75MVo8mvZqbAkg?e=XRMdBI) for usage.

### PY

The `PY` function executes Python code with optional repeating **scalar** arguments `data1, data2, ...` which are assigned to global variables and returns a **scalar** (e.g. 5 in a single cell).

```excel
=BOARDFLARE.PY(code, [data1])
```

| Argument | Type   | Optional | Description |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| code     | string | No       | Python code, or URL to code, e.g. `https://foo.com/code.py`.  Python code must assign global variable `pyout` with a **scalar** of type `int, float, bool, or str`. |
| data1    | number, string, boolean | Yes       | Repeating argument that will set global **scalar** variables `data1, data2, ..` which you can then reference in your code to pass in data. |

A simple example is as follows:

```excel
=BOARDFLARE.PY("pyout = data1 * data2", 5, 3)
```
This sets global variables `data1 = 5 ; data2 = 3`, evaluates to `pyout = 15`, and returns `15` in a single cell.

Or loading from URL:

```excel
=BOARDFLARE.PY("https://foo.com/code.py", 5, 3)
```
where `mycode.py` contains the same code as above.  Note that the URL must be served over HTTPS.

You could assign serialized arrays (e.g. using `ARRAYTOTEXT`) to `data1, data2, ..` and return a serialized array which you deserialize in Excel, but a simpler approach is to use the `PY.ARR` function below which natively handles arrays.

### PY.ARR

The `PY.ARR` function is the same as `PY` except that it takes arrays for `data1, data2, ...` and outputs an array result to Excel.  Remember that **an array variable in Excel is always a 2D array, or matrix**, even if it represents a single row or column, or even a single cell.  Excel custom functions use the term **matrix** instead of array to help clarify this, and that is what we will do here also.

```excel
=BOARDFLARE.PY.ARR(code, [data1])
```

| Argument | Type   | Optional | Description |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| code     | string | No       | Python code, or URL to code, e.g. `https://foo.com/code.py`.  Python code must assign global variable `pyout` with an **matrix** of elements of type `int, float, bool, or str`. |
| data1    | array | Yes       | Repeating argument that will set global **matrix** variables `data1, data2, ..`. Values can be a range `A2:A3`, array constant `{2,3}`, or a function that returns an array. | 

You could use `PY.ARR` for scalars, but since everything is handled as a matrix, it can be a bit cumbersome.  Let's implement the previous example using `PY.ARR`:
    
```excel
=BOARDFLARE.PY.ARR("pyout = [[data1[0][0] * data2[0][0]]]", {5}, {3})
```

See what we mean?  But for anything involving arrays, `PY.ARR` is the way to go.  Here's a simple example that takes a row array and returns a single cell:

```excel
=BOARDFLARE.PY.ARR("total = sum(data1[0]); pyout = [[total]]", {1,2})
```
This sets global `data1 = [[1,2]]`, so `pyout = [[3]]`, which outputs `3` in a single cell in Excel.

Or using numpy and returning a row:

```excel
=BOARDFLARE.PY.ARR("import numpy as np; total = np.sum(data1[0]).item(); pyout = [['Sales', total]]", {1,2})
```
This sets global `data1 = [[1,2]]`, so `pyout = [['Sales', 3]]`, which outputs a row with `Sales` in one cell and `3` in the next cell.

You can also load code from URL:

```excel
=BOARDFLARE.PY.ARR("https://foo.com/code.py", {1,2})
```

### PY.BETA

`PY.BETA` function has the same array input/output as `PY.ARR` but contains all the latest beta features/fixes before they are moved into the regular functions.  There are no noteworthy features to try in `PY.BETA` at the moment, so you can stick with `PY` and `PY.ARR` for now.

## Development

### Code from URL

Code can only be loaded from a URL if it is served over HTTPS due to browser security restrictions.  Deploying your code to a URL has two key advantages:

1. Centralized deployment.  Putting your Python code in a central location allows you to update it without having to update each Excel workbook that contains it.  

2. Version control.  If the central location is either a git repository (e.g. GitHub) or a storage location deployed to from a git repository (e.g. Azure Storage) you can properly version control your code.

A simple and free way to do this is to use a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/).  You can create a new Gist, paste your Python code into it, and then use the URL of the Gist in the `PY` function.  Make sure you click on the raw button in the Gist to get a URL that goes directly to your code [like this](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/bolleman/14e68b8d6a6e2897ef5f70dbd28ea7e3/raw/ce32551dd5df578371d70db563459d450921f13b/emails.py).

### Local IDE

If you are already using an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), pairing it up with something like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) enables you to serve your local code files with live reload as follows: 

```excel
=BOARDFLARE.PY.ARR("https://localhost:4000/mycode.py", {1,2})
```

In the first phase of development it may be convenient to simply hardcode the data1, data2, ... globals into your code so that you can test directly in your IDE with your local Python runtime.  You can use the fact that the Python `sys.platform` in Excel will be `emscripten` to only use the hardcoded data outside Excel.  For example:

```python
import sys

# Hard-code globals when NOT in Excel.
if sys.platform != 'emscripten':
    data1 = 2
    data2 = 3

# Print globals to console to check.
print(f"data1: {data1}, data2: {data2}")

pyout = data1 + data2
```

### JupyterLite

If you're familiar with JupyterLab or Notebooks, a great option is [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_static/lab/index.html) which is a JupyterLab distribution that runs in the browser using the same Pyodide Python kernal that this add-in is using.  This means that any code that runs in JupyterLite should run in Excel.  Right now you'll need to cut and paste your code into Excel, or push it to some location accessible by URL (e.g. GitHub Gist).  Note that the trick above of hard-coding globals will not work in JupyterLite, as the Python `sys.platform` will be the same as in Excel.  Instead you should load the globals in a previous cell so they are available to your code.

Since JupyterLite stores its files in the browser IndexedDB, if we hosted a JupyterLite instance on the same sub-domain as our add-in (so that they could share the same storage), it would enable you to directly reference your code files in Jupyter from they `PY` functions, similar to using a URL.  This would provide the equivalent of live reload from a Jupyter notebook.  If this is something you think would be useful, please [let us know](/company/support).

### ChatGPT

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and similar tools can be used to generate Python code snippets.  You can then copy and paste these snippets into Excel or a Gist and load the code from a URL.  This can be a great way to quickly prototype code, especially if you're not a Python developer.

## Applications

Some example applications are as follows:

1. **Data extraction**: Python has several libraries available for extracting data from strings.  For example, if you load HTML using PowerQuery, you could parse it using [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/).

2. **Data manipulation**: [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a popular library for manipulating tabular data and might be a good alternative to PowerQuery for some tasks.

3. **Using AI models**: AI models can be called via APIs with complex prompts and agentic patterns using packages like [LangChain](https://pypi.org/project/langchain/).

4. **Calling APIs**:  For example, let's say you're trying to call a REST API and manipulate the JSON response into something useful.
