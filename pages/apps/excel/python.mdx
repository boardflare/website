## Overview

Create an Excel [LAMBDA function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/lambda-function-bd212d27-1cd1-4321-a34a-ccbf254b8b67) from a Python function in two easy steps as follows:
 
<Steps>
### Write a Python function
Using the add-in code editor, write or paste your function code, e.g.:
```python
def inches_to_mm(inches):
    """ Converts inches to millimeters. """
    return inches * 25.4
```
 
### Save to create LAMBDA
Python code is stored in workbook settings.  A LAMBDA function is added to the name manager:
```excel
=LAMBDA(inches, BOARDFLARE.RUNPY("workbook-settings:inches_to_mm", inches))
```

A named function is now available for use in the workbook:
```excel
=INCHES_TO_MM(inches)
```
</Steps>

Let's use another example to explain the process in more detail.  Suppose you have the following Python function:

```python
def hello(first, last):
    """ Returns a greeting. """
    greeting = f"Hello {first, last}!"
    return greeting
```

When you save this code, the Python function name `hello` and arguments `first, last` are parsed to create a LAMBDA function `=LAMBDA(first, last, BOARDFLARE.RUNPY("workbook-settings:hello", first, last))` which is saved to the name manager with the name `HELLO`.  The Python code is saved to the [workbook settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/excel/excel-add-ins-workbooks#access-document-settings) so it is embedded in the workbook.  The first line of the Python function docstring is also added as a comment to the name manager to provide a description users can see when they use the function.

![Hello Function](/images/hello-function.png)

Each time the function is invoked, `BOARDFLARE.RUNPY` loads the code from the workbook settings and runs it with the arguments.  Since the code and LAMBDA are both stored in the workbook, anyone who uses the workbook can use the function.  If they don't have the add-in installed, Excel will automatically prompt them to do so.

## Features

Some key features of the add-in are as follows:

‚úÖ Use Python in formulas and LAMBDA functions.<br/>
üÜì Free add-in, no Office 365 license required.<br/>
üåê Works in Excel for web as well as desktop.<br/>
‚òÅÔ∏è Runtime has network access for API calls (needs CORS).<br/>
üì¶ Import custom packages (pure Python only).<br/>
üîí Code is stored in your workbook and runs locally.<br/>
üöÄ No user sign-in is required to run functions.<br/>

### Editor Tab

The add-in `Editor` tab contains a code editor ([Monaco](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor), same as VS Code) that allows you to write Python code with syntax highlighting.  When you save your code a LAMBDA function is created from your Python code.  You can also run [test cases](#test-cases) to verify your function.  If you drag the task pane open for more room, you will have the following view:

![Code Editor](/images/code-editor.png)

The bottom bar of the editor tab contains the following controls:

- `Select a function...`:  Enables you to load a different function in the workbook into the editor.  Make sure you save any changes before switching functions.
- `Reset`:  Returns the editor to its initial default function.
- `Test`:  Runs the [test cases](#test-cases) defined in the Python code.  You will be taken to the `Output` tab to view the results.
- `Save`:  Saves the code in the editor to workbook settings and create a LAMBDA function.  If an existing function of the same name exists, it will be updated.

### Functions Tab

The `Functions` tab displays a list of all the Python functions saved in the workbook.  Clicking edit on a function returns you to the editor tab with that function loaded, the same as if you loaded it from the functions dropdown in the code editor.  You can also delete functions from the workbook.  If you want to edit the name, arguments, or description of a function, you can do so directly in the code editor. 

![Functions Tab](/images/functions-tab.png)

The bottom portion of the tab enables you to load pre-built example functions from Jupyter notebooks we have created.  This enables you to see example functions and use them as a starting point for your own functions.  Or simply use them as-is.  First select the notebook with the functions you want to import, then click `Import Noteboook Functions`.  This will load the functions into the workbook and create a demo sheet in Excel which invokes each function with an example argument.

You may also import functions from a notebook stored in a GitHub Gist such as the [following example](https://gist.github.com/bolleman/c2d1e1bf47680f8e5d699a2ae1be8c82).  Paste the URL of the Gist into the `Enter notebook URL` form and click the `Add` button.  The notebook will now be available in the `Select a notebook...` dropdown to import into the workbook.  If you update the code in the Gist, you can click the `Import Notebook Functions` button to update the functions in the workbook.  This is the workflow we use when building functions using VS Code.  If you add a `boardflare` object in the notebook metadata as follows, this metadata will be used in the Functions tab:

```json
{
  "boardflare": {
    "title": "Example Functions",
    "description": "A collection of example functions."
  }
}
```

To get an example invocation of each function in the demo sheet, you need to add a comment to each function in the notebook as follows:

```python
def add_num(a, b):
    """ Returns the sum of two numbers. """
    return a + b

# Excel usage: =ADD_NUM(1, 2)
```

## Writing Code

Some things to be aware of when writing your Python code are outlined in the following sections.

### Importing Packages

[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/index.html) is the Python runtime used by the add-in, and includes a number of [built-in packages](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html). You can import any of these packages as well as those from the Python standard library. Any imports for external Python packages will be loaded from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), but only if they are pure Python, and depend on any packages that are either built into pyodide or also pure Python.  Packages tagged as [OS-independent](https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Operating+System+%3A%3A+OS+Independent) on PyPI should work.

Your code will be scanned for imports and any found will be handled for you using `micropip` in the background and the package will be downloaded if needed from PyPI. If you try to import an external package (not part of the Python standard library or one of the built-in packages) for which there is not a pure Python wheel available on PyPI, an error will be thrown.  However, specific imports (e.g., `from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential`) will not automatically install the relevant package. You need to handle these manually using `await micropip.install(['package1', 'package2'])`. `micropip` has already been imported for you, and since the Python code is executed async, you can use a top-level await as follows:

```python
await micropip.install(['azure-ai-textanalytics'])
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
```

### Type Conversion

The following type conversions will take place on the arguments passed to your function from Excel:

| Excel Type | Excel Example                  | Python Type | Python Example |
|------------|--------------------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Number     | 42                             | int         | 42             |
| Number     | 3.14                           | float       | 3.14           |
| String     | "hello"                        | str         | "hello"        |
| Boolean    | TRUE                           | bool        | True           |
| Array      | `{1, 2, 3}`                    | List or DataFrame* | [[1, 2, 3]] or pd.DataFrame([[1, 2, 3]]) |
| Array      | A1:B2                          | List or DataFrame* | [[1, 2], [3, 4]] or pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) |
| Null       | Reference to an empty cell     | None        | None           |
| Null       | Unset optional LAMBDA argument | None        | None           |
| Null       | Arg skipped with `,`           | None        | None           |
| Date       | 45678 (serial format)          | int         | 45678 - not converted to datetime   |

*Conversion to a DataFrame only occurs if the code contains a pandas import.

The value returned by your Python function will similarly be converted to the corresponding Excel type as follows:

| Python Type             | Python Example              | Excel Type | Excel Example                |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|------------------------------|
| int                     | 42                          | Number     | 42                           |
| float                   | 3.14                        | Number     | 3.14                         |
| str                     | "hello"                     | String     | "hello"                      |
| bool                    | True                        | Boolean    | TRUE                         |
| 2D list (Matrix)        | [[1, 2], [3, 4]]            | Array      | A1:B2**                       |
| 2D list (Column Vector) | [[1], [2], [3]]             | Array      | A1:A3**                       |
| 2D list (Row Vector)    | [[1, 2, 3]]                 | Array      | A1:C1**                       |
| pandas DataFrame*        | pd.DataFrame([[1, 2, 3]])   | Array      | A1:C1**                       |
| None                    | None                        | Null       | Reference to an empty cell   |

*Conversion of a DataFrame to an array only occurs if code contains a pandas import.
**Assumes formula is in cell A1.

If your function returns another Python type such as numpy, dict, tuple, etc., an error will be thrown.

### Test Cases

If you define a `test_cases` variable in your code with a list of arguments, these will be used to test your function when you click `Test` in the editor.  You will be taken to the `Output` tab where you view the output from executing the function with the arguments provided in the `test_cases`.  Note that the arguments need to be in the same order as the function arguments and are the Python type expected by the function.  These `test_cases` run entirely in the Python environment so the Excel-to-Python type conversions noted above do not apply.

For examnple:

```python
def hello(first, last):
    """ Returns a greeting. """
    greeting = f"Hello {first, last}!"
    return greeting
    
# Test cases for the function.
test_cases = [["Nancy", "Morgan"], ["Ming", "Lee"]]
```

If your function only has one argument, you can omit the inner list:

```python
def square(x):
    """ Returns the square of a number. """
    return x ** 2

# Test cases for the function.
test_cases = [2, 3, 4]
```
If you have a function that takes an array as an argument, you can define the test cases as follows:

```python
def sum_array(arr):
    """
    Returns the sum of the first sub-array in a 2D list of integers.
    
    Parameters:
    arr (list of list of int): A 2D list of integers.
    
    Returns:
    list of list of int: A 2D list containing the sum of the first sub-array.
    """
    return sum(arr[0])

# Test cases for the function.
test_cases = [[[1, 2, 3]], [[4, 5, 6]]]
```
As mentioned above in the [Type Conversion](#type-conversion) section, Excel arrays will always be converted to 2D lists (unless pandas is imported, then DataFrames), so construct your function and test_cases accordingly.

### Limitations

- Default arguments are not supported, e.g., `def add(a=1, b=2):`.  If the user omits an argument in the LAMBDA, it will be passed as `None`, which you can handle to set the default in your Python code.  e.g. `if a is None: a = 1`.
- `*args` and `**kwargs` are not supported.

## BOARDFLARE.RUNPY

The `RUNPY` function can be used directly instead of using the [code editor](#code-editor) to build a LAMBDA function if you want to work with a lower-level API.  `RUNPY` takes a Python code string and a repeating positional argument `arg1, arg2, ...` (similar to Python *args) and returns the result.  The syntax is as follows:

```excel
=BOARDFLARE.RUNPY(code, [arg1],[arg2],...)
```

```excel
=BOARDFLARE.RUNPY("2 + arg1", 3) = 5
```

The value of the last expression is returned, and undergoes the [type conversion](#type-conversion) noted earlier. For example:

```python
import numpy as np

def add(a, b):
    return np.add(a, b).item()  # Call item() to convert numpy scalar to Python scalar.

add(arg1, arg2)  # This value of this expression will be returned.
```
See this [brief video](https://youtu.be/ngxM7VRkkgk) and [example workbook](https://whistlernetworks.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Boardflare/EZ3eKR1wcltImmG2OA4sX-kB8RSA2cvJFM-hPoQGGdwMmA?e=m0eFdd) for more examples.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Why am I getting Excel errors like `#VALUE!`, `#NAME?`, `#BUSY!`?</summary>
  - `#VALUE!`:  An argument to a function is missing or it is the wrong type (e.g. incorrect range reference).
  - `#NAME?`:  The function name is spelled incorrectly, e.g. `BOARDFLARE.RUNPYY`.
  - `#BUSY!`:  This is normal for 5-10 seconds if you are importing libraries for the first time and have a slow internet connection. 

  To the left of the bottom of the task pane, you may also see additional errors such as the following:

  - `Error loading add-ins`
  - `We're starting the add-ins runtime, just a moment...`

  Sometimes Excel will throw various errors when the custom function is not properly initialized, in which case you can try restarting Excel, or reloading the browser window.

<details>
  <summary>Can Python code access the network?</summary>
  You should be able to access any public API that supports [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I build a LAMBDA function using the native Excel PY instead of RUNPY?</summary>
  Unfortuantely, no, that is the original reason we built this add-in.  At this time the Excel PY function does not allow you to call it from a formula.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How can I access local files on my machine?</summary>
  No. The Pyodide runtime runs in a [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) in the browser which does not have access to your local machine.  This is a browser security feature.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Where is `stdout` or `stderr` is displayed?</summary>
  Any output to `stdout` or `stderr` is displayed in the `Output` tab of the add-in task pane, but it is only returned at the completion of the execution of your code.  
</details>
