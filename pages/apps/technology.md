# Technology

Most of the magic comes courtesy of [Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/index), which is a library that enables machine learning models on Hugging Face to run in a browser.  Since Excel and Sheets extensions are just web apps, it provides a means of running machine learning models without moving the data out of the spreadsheet environment.  The models are cached in the browser, but there is nothing installed on the local operating system.
