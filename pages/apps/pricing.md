# Pricing

Boardflare apps are available in three pricing plans: Free, Lite, and Pro.  Credits for use of premium models and services are aggregated at the account level and shared across all apps.  Credits are consumed based on the number of requests made to premium models and services, and are replenished at the beginning of each billing month.  The number of credits consumed per request varies by model and service, and is detailed in the documentation for each model and service.  You are free to change or cancel your pricing plan at any time.
