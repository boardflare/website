# Pricing

<h3>Unlimited Free Use</h3>

Boardflare apps for Excel and Sheets provide unlimited free use of base machine learning models that run locally on your CPU.  These models are sufficient for many purposes, and no subscription, or even account regisration, is required to use them.  

<h3>Subscription Plans</h3>

More advanced models with additional capabilities require credits to use.  You are given an initial allotment of free credits to try the advanced models when you sign up.  We are also previewing subscription plans that provide additional credits for regular use.  These plans are as follows:

<ul>
    <li>Free: 200 credits/mo. The way the system is set up you have to "purchase" a free plan, which requires a billing method, even though you will not be charged.  Microsoft handles all billing and does not share any of this information.  Our apologies for any inconvenience.</li>
    <li>Preview: $2/mo. 1,000 credits/mo., for a limited time only.  This is a very deep discount on comparable services. e.g. 1,000 credits enables translation of 1M characters of text, which would cost $30 using other providers such as DeepL.</li>
</ul>

Plans with more credits will become available in the future.  In the meantime, if you need more credits, please contact us and we'll try to help you out.  

Some details to note about how the subscription plans work are as follows: 

<ul>
    <li>Your subscription adds a monthly allotment of credits to your account that can be used with any Boardflare app in Excel or Sheets that consumes credits.</li>
    <li>Plans renew monthly, and you can upgrade or downgrade your plan based on your needs.</li>
    <li>Credits are reset to the monthly allotment of your plan on renewal, at the beginning of each billing month.  Unused credits do not roll over to the following month.</li>
    <li>The number of credits consumed per request varies by model and service, and is detailed in the documentation. For example, 1 credit = 1000 characters of text for a premium translation model.</li>
    <li>Each user can only purchase one seat for their own use. If you need to purchase multiple seats at once, please contact us.</li>
    <li>You may cancel your subscription through the Microsoft billing portal.  Cancellations within 72 hours of purchase receive a refund, after that there are no refunds.  We suggest you start with the Free plan to make sure it meets your needs.</li>
    <li>All billing is handled by Microsoft, so we do not see your billing information, and have no control over refunds and other billing adjustments.</li>
</ul>

### Getting Started

Go to AppSource to purchase a subscription, even for the free plan.

Once you click "Get it now", you will be prompted to sign in with your Microsoft account, after which you can select a subscription plan, select your billing address and method (including for free plans), and then purchase.  You will then be taken to a confirmation page that shows your purchase details and has "Configure SaaS Account" button.  You will also receive an email with similar information, and a "Configure Account" button.  Clicking either button will take you to our website where we will confirm your purchase, and update the credits on your account.  You can then use the app in Excel or Sheets as you normally would, and your credits will be consumed as you use the app.
