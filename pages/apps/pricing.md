# Pricing

## Free

Boardflare apps for Excel and Sheets provide unlimited free use of basic machine learning models that run locally on your CPU.  These models are sufficient for many purposes, and no subscription, or even account registration, is required to use them.  

## Premium

Premium models with additional capabilities are currently available for Microsoft work/school account holders only.  We use AppSource for handling billing and unfortunately it does not support personal accounts.  When you sign-in with your work/school account you will be granted some initial free credits.  After those are consumed, you will need a [Boardflare premium subscription](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/web-apps/whistlernetworksinc1621738129547.boardflare-flatrate), as outlined below.

The cost to use premium models varies by model and service, and is detailed in the documentation for each app.  For example, US$1 = 1000 credits = 1 million characters of text for the premium translation model.  As a comparison, the Google translation API costs US$20 for 1M characters of text.

## Subscription

### Plans

The following subscription plans are available on AppSource:

- Free: 200 credits/mo. Note that AppSource requires you to "purchase" a free plan, which requires a billing method, even though you will not be charged.  Microsoft handles all billing and does not share any of this information with us.  Our apologies for any inconvenience.
- Starter: USD $2/mo. 2,000 credits/mo.  e.g. this provides 2 million characters of premium translation per month.

Plans with more credits will become available once we have a better sense of consumption patterns, but feel free to reach out to us if you need more credits now.

### Terms

- Your subscription adds a monthly allotment of credits to your account that can be used with any Boardflare add-in for Excel.
- Purchase a plan for a single month, or to automatically renew monthly.
- Credits are reset to the monthly allotment of your plan on renewal, at the beginning of each billing month. Unused credits do not roll over to the following month.
- The number of credits consumed per request varies by model and service, and is detailed in the documentation for that service. For example, 1 credit = 1000 characters of text for a premium translation model.
- Each user currently must purchase their own subscription, but we are working on a way to share a subscription with a team.
- You may cancel your subscription through the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/?source=applauncher#/subscriptions). Cancellations within 72 hours of purchase receive a full refund, after that there are no refunds.
- All billing and refunds are handled by Microsoft, so we do not see your billing information, and have no control over refunds and other billing adjustments.
- Due to AppSource restrictions, subscriptions are only available to Microsoft work/school account holders in countries where Microsoft collects tax on our behalf.  Personal accounts are not supported.
- For more information, see the [Microsoft Marketplace Terms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/marketplace/marketplace-terms).

Once you click "Get it now", you will be prompted to sign in with your Microsoft account, after which you can select a subscription plan, select your billing address and method (including for free plans), and then purchase.  You will then be taken to a confirmation page that shows your purchase details and has "Configure SaaS Account" button.  You will also receive an email with similar information, and a "Configure Account" button.  Clicking either button will take you to our website where we will confirm your purchase, and update the credits on your account.  You can then use the app in Excel or Sheets as you normally would, and your credits will be consumed as you use the app.
