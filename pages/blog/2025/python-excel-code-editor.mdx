# Python for Excel Code Editor
January 18, 2025

## Overview

We're excited to announce a major update to our Python for Excel add-in that makes it easier than ever to create Excel LAMBDA functions from Python code. The new code editor provides a familiar VS Code-like experience right inside Excel, with features like syntax highlighting, function management, and integrated testing.

## Key Features

### Monaco Editor Integration
The add-in now includes the same editor ([Monaco](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor)) used in VS Code, providing:
- Syntax highlighting for Python
- Code completion and formatting
- Error detection

### Function Management
A new Functions tab lets you:
- View all Python functions in your workbook
- Edit existing functions
- Delete unused functions
- Import functions from Jupyter notebooks

### Testing Integration
Write test cases directly in your Python code:

```python
def hello(first, last):
    """ Returns a greeting. """
    greeting = f"Hello {first, last}!"
    return greeting
    
# Test cases for the function
test_cases = [["Nancy", "Morgan"], ["Ming", "Lee"]]

# Excel usage: =HELLO("Nancy", "Morgan")
```

Click "Test" to run your cases and see results in the Output tab.

## How It Works

Creating a Python-powered LAMBDA function is now a two-step process:

1. Write your Python function in the editor
2. Click Save to create the LAMBDA

The Python code is stored in workbook settings and a corresponding LAMBDA function is automatically created in Excel's name manager. For example, this Python function:

```python
def inches_to_mm(inches):
    """ Converts inches to millimeters. """
    return inches * 25.4
```

Creates this LAMBDA in Excel:

```excel
=LAMBDA(inches, BOARDFLARE.EXEC("workbook-settings:inches_to_mm", inches))
```

## Jupyter Notebook Integration

A particularly exciting feature is the ability to import functions from Jupyter notebooks. You can:
- Import from our example notebooks
- Load notebooks from GitHub Gists
- Use the notebooks as templates for your own functions

This makes it easy to maintain a library of functions in notebooks and import them into Excel as needed.

## Try It Out

To get started with the new code editor:

1. Install the [Python for Excel add-in](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200007447?tab=Overview)
2. Open the task pane and go to the Editor tab
3. Try writing a simple function or import one of our examples
4. Click Save to create your LAMBDA function

The code editor is available now in version 1.1.0 of the add-in. For more details, check out our [updated documentation](/apps/excel/python).

## What's Next?

We're continuing to improve the editor experience. Coming soon:
- Support for optional arguments
- More example notebooks
- Enhanced type conversion options
