# About

Our focus is on providing custom functions that enable spreadsheet users to solve a much broader range of business problems, many of which previously required specialized SaaS or custom developed software.

AI is the driving force behind this, as it enables two key things:

1. **AI Functions**.  Custom functions that are powered by AI models directly.  These can be simple tasks such as translation, e.g. `=BOARDFLARE.TRANSLATE(text, source_lang, target_lang)`, or more complex numerical tasks, e.g. `BOARDFLARE.FORECAST(income_stat, balance_sheet, cash_flow)` which takes financial results and calculates a forecast. 

2. **AI Assistants**.  AI assistants such as ChatGPT enable end-users to write the code behind custom functions without coding skills.  This facilitates the creation of hyper-specialized functions, instead of the end-user having to adapt to the limitations of a generic tool.

Boardflare operates as a virtual team based out of Whistler, Canada.  We would love to [hear from you](mailto:support@boardflare.com).
