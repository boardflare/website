# About

Our mission is make AI analysis tools more accessible by making them both easier to use and less expensive.  By integrating our tools into spreadsheet applications, they are easier to access for the average user who is not a data scientist.  By running the AI models powering our tools locally in the browser, we are able to provide unlimited local processing without concerns about API costs. Furthermore, all our tools have free versions that can be used with the free versions of Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.

We are a virtual team based in Whistler, Canada.
