# Similarity Analysis Tools

## Overview

Similarity analysis measures the semantic similarity between two pieces of text, and is commonly used in search engines, recommendation systems, text classification, etc. 

A common use-case in spreadsheets is what is known as "fuzzy matching" or "fuzzy lookup", where you want to find similar text for deduplication, data cleaning, and other tasks.
