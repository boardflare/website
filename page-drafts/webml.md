# WebML - Browser-based Machine Learning
January 15, 2024

## What is WebML?
WebML involves running machine learning models in the browser, without the need for a backend server or external API. This is made possible by leveraging technologies like WebAssembly (WASM), WebGL, and WebGPU to perform computations directly in the browser. WebML is ideal for applications that require real-time analysis, have privacy-sensitive data, or simply want to reduce costs.

## Frameworks for running machine learning models in the browser
There are several frameworks available for running machine learning models in the browser. Some of the popular ones include:

- [ML.js](https://github.com/mljs/ml?tab=readme-ov-file): Provides a collection of classical supervised (e.g. random forest) and unsupervised (e.g. k-means) machine learning algorithms implemented in JavaScript.

- [Wink NLP.js](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/): Focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like tokenization, stemming, and sentiment analysis.

- [TensorFlow.js](): A JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models.

- [ONNX runtime web](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/get-started/with-javascript/web.html): A JavaScript library for running ONNX models in the browser.


## Benefits of WebML
WebML offers several benefits, including:

- **Real-time analysis**: WebML enables real-time analysis of data directly in the browser, without the need for a backend server.

- **Privacy**: Since the data never leaves the user's device, WebML is ideal for applications that handle sensitive data.

- **Cost-effective**: By offloading computations to the client-side, WebML can reduce the load on backend servers and save costs associated with cloud services.

- **Offline support**: WebML allows applications to run even when the user is offline, making it suitable for progressive web apps.

## Use cases for WebML
WebML can be used in a variety of applications, including:

- **Image recognition**: WebML can be used to perform real-time image recognition directly in the browser.

- **Natural language processing**: WebML can be used for tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, and named entity recognition.

- **Anomaly detection**: WebML can help detect anomalies in real-time data streams, such as network traffic or sensor data.

- **Recommendation systems**: WebML can power recommendation systems that provide personalized suggestions to users.
