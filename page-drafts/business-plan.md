## Market
- end-users who need specialized lambda functions.
- developers/power-users who want to build custom lambdas.

## Key differentiators
- Python as a function: use in formulas, LAMBDAs, etc.
- Code via URL (e.g. gist):  use vs-code, chatgpt, etc. to build, update centrally.
- Network access call APIs such as OpenAI, etc.
- Local AI model access.

## Website
- Functions page which has embedded workbook with all functions, descriptions, code (link to gist or repo), etc.  User can copy to add named lambdas to workbook, since code is not stored in workbook this doesn't bloat the workbook.  Split up workbooks by task category to simplify further, and allows embedding in tasks also.
- Discuss functions in tasks.

## Paid features
- User auth for authenticated API calls (e.g. Graph, [LLM proxy](https://docs.litellm.ai/), etc.)
- Multi-core processing.
- AI code generation in add-in.
- Larger and specialized local models.
- Deploy to API to use from power automate, copilot action, etc.
- Source code license to proprietary functions.

## ChatGPT workflow:
- Chatgpt with custom GPT and action to push code to gist or onedrive.
- Test in workbook via url.

## Students / Contractors
- Run competitions to build functions to address specific use-cases.
- Part of their job is to determine use-cases, gather example data, etc.
- Submit as shared workbook.
