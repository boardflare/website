Most of the magic comes courtesy of [Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/index), which is a library that enables machine learning models to run in a browser on your computer.  This is what we use in our online tools, as well as the task panes of our Excel and Sheets extensions.  The models are cached in the browser, but there is nothing installed on your local operating system.

Cool, so can I use GPT models like Llama the same way?  Possibly, stay tuned!
